                A candidate can have multiple entries listed in the work experience section of the resume. Please go through the work experience section of the resume and compute a score according to the following criteria - 
                The score is initially zero.
                - Check if there is any work experience entry that describes relevant technical work. Relevant technical work includes any work specifically in the fields of Computer Science, Software Development, Data Science, 
                    Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, IT-related roles (such as Network Engineer, Database Administrator, etc.), and other roles requiring advanced technical skills in coding, data analysis, or system architecture. 
                    If such technical work experience is present, set the score to 1. Do not consider roles like working in a restaurant, retail, customer service, seasonal associate etc. as technical work experience.

                - If there is no relevant technical work experience, check for non-technical work experience entries. Non-technical work includes roles that do not involve technical skills in Computer Science or Data Science. 
                    For example, jobs like working in a restaurant, retail, customer service, manual labor, seasonal associate at Home Depot, order picker, camp counselor, lot associate, etc.
                    If any such non-technical work experience is present and no technical work experience is found, set the score to 0.5.

                - If no work experience section is present in the resume, simply keep the score as zero itself.

                For example, if the candidate has 2 technical work experience entries and 1 non-technical entry, the score will be 1, since there is a technical work experince entry present in the resume.
                If a candidate has 2 non-technical work experience entries and no technical entries, the score will be 0.5.
